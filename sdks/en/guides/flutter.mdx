## 1. Set Up Flutter Development Environment

Follow the instructions on the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to set up your Flutter development environment. If you already have Flutter set up, you can skip this step.

### Download the Git Repository

If you want to use the sample project, download the Git repository with the following command:

Download the [Furo Flutter Sample](https://github.com/lukasjhan/furo-sample-flutter) project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukasjhan/furo-sample-flutter
```

If you want to create your project from scratch, follow the guide below.

### Install and Use the web_auth Library

In this guide, we will use the [flutter_web_auth](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_web_auth/latest/) library. Please refer to the link for information about the library.

- Installation

Add the library to the dependencies section in the pubspec.yaml file. Here's an example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  flutter_web_auth: ^0.5.0
  http: ^0.13.6
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2

assets: lib/.env # path to your .env
```

- Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web_auth/flutter_web_auth.dart';

final result = await FlutterWebAuth.authenticate(
        url: loginUrl,
        callbackUrlScheme: scheme
);

final code = Uri.parse(result).queryParameters['code'];
print(code);
```

| Parameter Name    | Description                                                                                                                   | Type   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| url               | URL of the login page                                                                                                         | string |
| callbackUrlScheme | URI scheme (deep link) to receive the callback after authentication: web: http/https, mobile: {app.scheme} [e.g., youtube://] | string |

<Warning>
  The "callbackUrlScheme" must be a valid scheme string. A valid RFC 3986 URL
  scheme should start with a letter and consist of letters, numbers, plus sign
  ("+"), period (".") or hyphen ("-").
</Warning>

        // application has a blue toolbar. Then, without quitting the app, try
        // changing the primarySwatch below to Colors.green and then invoke
        // "hot reload" (press "r" in the console where you ran "flutter run",
        // or simply save your changes to "hot reload" in a Flutter IDE).

  // This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the values (in this

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done
    // by the _incrementCounter method above.

    // fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather
    // than having to individually change instances of widgets.

## 2. Integrate Furo Login

1. Copy **.env** value to .env file in project directory to lib/.env. Or, create a **.env** file and set the environment variables as follows. If you cannot use the .env file, enter the Client ID obtained from the console as clientId in the main.dart file.

```bash
CLIENT_ID="{{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}}"
```

2. Change the Default Callback URI in the console's input box from the default value `https://sample.furo.one/{{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}}` to `http://localhost:3000/{{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}}`.

<Accordion title="redirectUri and callbackUri">
- These are properties used when redirecting the user to a specific page within the application after login.

- You can specify redirectUri within the app, and Default Callback URI can be set in the Furo Console.

- The redirectUri specified within the app is subject to potential malicious manipulation during communication. Therefore, the redirectUri will work correctly only for URIs registered in the Default Callback URI in the Furo Console.

</Accordion>

### Web

Change the Default Callback URI in the console's input box from the default value `https://sample.furo.one/{{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}}` to `http://localhost:{port}/auth.html`.

Add an auth.html file under the web directory of your project.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Authentication complete</title>
<p>
  Authentication is complete. If this does not happen automatically, please
  close the window.
  <script>
    console.log(window.location.href);
    window.opener.postMessage(
      {
        'flutter-web-auth': window.location.href,
      },
      window.location.origin
    );
    window close();
  </script>
</p>
```

After starting the project, click the login button to log in to Furo.

### Android

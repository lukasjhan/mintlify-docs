# State query

When redirecting to [redirect_uri] after login, you can use a state query to pass additional information. Simply add the state query to the login URL. The added query value will be passed as is when redirected to the redirect_uri.

- Example of state query in login URL

```
https://auth.furo.one/login/{pid}?state={state}
```

After the login is complete, the URL when moving to [redirect_uri] will be as follows. You can handle the state value found in the URL after the redirect.

- Example URL when moving to [redirect_uri]

```
https://[redirect_uri]?state={state}&code={code}
```
